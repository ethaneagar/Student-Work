# CS210 7-3 > Project 3 > Corner Grocer
---
This was created for Project 3, which I wrote in C++.
+ This project needed to analyze the text records Corner Grocer generated throughout the day. 
+ The project gave the client the ability to determine how often items are purchased so they could create the most effective layout for their customers.

What did you do particularly well?
+ File IO went well, and I had early success in the project, proving out the approach I wanted to take.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
+ 
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
+ 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
+ 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
