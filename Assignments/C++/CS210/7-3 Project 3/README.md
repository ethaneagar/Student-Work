# CS210 7-3 > Project 3 > Corner Grocer
---
This was created for Project 3, which I wrote in C++.
+ This project needed to analyze the text records Corner Grocer generated throughout the day. 
+ The project gave the client the ability to determine how often items are purchased so they could create the most effective layout for their customers.

+ What did you do particularly well?
  + File IO went well, and I had early success in the project, proving out the approach I wanted to take.
+ Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  + I think this project could be rewritten to abstract the class into its own cpp and header files. 
+ Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write,\ and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  + I felt unsure of having the display menu functionality inside the class or if it should have been static. 
+ What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or coursework?
  + File IO will certainly be a transferable piece of code that I will refer to in the future. 
+ How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  + I kept the project in one cpp file as I was developing, keeping it easy to maintain. I think for development, that worked, but long-term, abstracting it would still allow ease of maintainability.
